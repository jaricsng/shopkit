"""Shared logic for tools/scaffold.py and tools/sync_check.py.

Single source of truth for: app-name placeholder substitution (and its
inverse, needed by sync_check.py to compare a scaffolded file back against
the kit's still-templated source), and the map of which kit file/directory
ends up at which path in a scaffolded repo. Keeping this in one module is
the same rule TECH-STACK-SWAP-GUIDE.md's footer states: when two tools
need the same fact, fix the shared interface, don't let them drift apart.
